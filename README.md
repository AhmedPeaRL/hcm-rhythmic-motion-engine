# HCM Rhythmic Motion Engine

This repository contains executable motion code
that does not decide, respond, or optimize.

Motion exists here as a continuous condition,
not as a reaction.

If nothing interacts — motion continues.
If something interacts — motion remains unchanged.

This engine serves Presence by preventing stillness
from becoming dead,
and motion from becoming demand.
